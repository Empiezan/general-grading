        <h3>What information do you collect?</h3>
        <p>
            This app collects form data provided by the user for a particular test, including the test ID,
            the ID of the student who took the test, the question number whose score is being reported,
            and the score for that question.
        </p>
        <h3>How do you use the information?</h3>
        <p>
            By providing authorization to this app, you give this app permission to modify the spreadsheets
            (that were shared with you) for the grading of the Individual, Topics, and Team exams for the
            Washington University Chemistry Tournament. This app reads and writes to the aforementioned
            spreadsheets, but will not modify, delete, or insert any other spreadsheets in the user's Google Drive.
        </p>
        <h3>What information do you share?</h3>
        <p>
            Besides the form data the user submits that is present in the Individual, Topics, and Team spreadsheets,
            this app will not share or store any other information about the user. Only users with which these
            spreadsheets have been shared can access this information. These users are limited to the students
            volunteering to assist in grading for the Washington University Chemistry Tournament.
        </p>
